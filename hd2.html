        <h1>Title: Customs and Traditions during Tet and Lunar New Year in Vietnam</h1>
        The Lunar New Year, commonly known as Tet, holds significant cultural importance in Vietnam. It is a time for
        family reunions, expressing gratitude, honoring ancestors, and sharing joy. This article explores the unique
        customs and traditions observed during Tet in Vietnam.

        1. **Tet Celebration Period:**
        Tet typically spans from the 30th day of the twelfth lunar month to the third day of the first lunar month.
        Preparation for Tet involves cleaning and decorating homes, shopping, and creating a festive atmosphere filled
        with warmth and vibrant colors.

        2. **Family Reunions:**
        People return to their hometowns to gather with their families in a cozy atmosphere. Families come together
        around the dinner table, pay respects to ancestors through rituals, and share stories and experiences from the
        past year. This time is crucial for expressing gratitude and strengthening family bonds.

        3. **Lucky Money (Lì Xì):**
        The tradition of giving lucky money is common during Tet. Adults often give red envelopes containing money to
        children and those younger than them. This gesture symbolizes financial prosperity and conveys good wishes for
        the recipients.

        4. **Traditional Cakes - Bánh Chưng and Bánh Tét:**
        Bánh chưng in the North and bánh tét in the South are two traditional cakes exclusive to Tet. They symbolize
        prosperity, good luck, and family unity. Making these cakes at home is a common practice, showcasing care and
        attention to loved ones.

        5. **Art and Cultural Events:**
        Throughout Tet, various art and cultural events such as fairs, dragon dance performances, lantern festivals, and
        flower festivals take place nationwide. These activities not only preserve cultural values but also create a
        joyful and vibrant atmosphere within the community.
